**Fixed Code:**

```python
def detect_cycle(node):
    hare = tortoise = node
 
    while True:
        if hare is None or hare.successor is None:
            return False

        tortoise = tortoise.successor
        hare = hare.successor.successor

        if hare is tortoise:
            return True
```

**Explanation of the Fix:**

The original code only checked if `hare.successor` is `None`. However, if `hare` itself is `None` (which can happen if the list is empty), trying to access `hare.successor` will raise an `AttributeError`.  The corrected code adds a check for `hare is None` before accessing `hare.successor`. This ensures that the code handles the edge case where the list is empty or the hare reaches the end of the list before its successor.
